We have now seen three ethical theories as well as their pitfalls. We have also thoroughly discussed their applications to the justifibility chat GPT.

# Now it is your turn to demonstrate your own understanding and mastery of these philosophical concepts. To what extent, or under what circumstances, is the use of Chat-GPT justifiable in academic settings? Use (at least) one of the above principles as a supporting argument for your position. Argue for your position in one page or less. (*Note: to use a principle discussed in class, you should first define it and then show how it is applicable in this case. That is, utilitarians states... In the case of GPT it would argue that...*)

The use of GPT in academic settings is justifiable when it functions as a tool to enhance learning rather than replace critical thinking or original thought. From a utilitarian perspective, which argues that actions are morally right if they promote the greatest benefit for the greatest number, GPT provides immediate assistance and explanations and helps students grasp difficult concepts through examples, detailed explanations, and interactive engagement, thereby fostering deeper understanding. This aligns with the principle of maximizing educational benefit, as it supports learning and personal growth for a wide range of students. The flexibility of the tool allows for more inclusive learning environments, where students with different learning styles or paces can benefit equally, thereby promoting the greatest good for the greatest number.

From a virtue ethics perspective, the focus is on the development of good character and intellectual virtues. GPT, when used appropriately, can foster virtues like curiosity, diligence, and wisdom. It provides an opportunity for students to explore complex ideas, seek clarity, and engage in deeper learning on their own terms. By encouraging students to take the initiative in their educational journey, GPT can help cultivate a love of learning and intellectual growth. Students who actively use the tool to better understand challenging material are practicing the virtue of curiosity, and by persisting in their studies with the help of GPT, they are developing the virtue of diligence. Over time, this can lead to the cultivation of wisdom, as students develop a more nuanced understanding of the subjects they study. Rather than promoting shortcuts or replacing individual effort, GPT supports the development of habits that reinforce good intellectual character, making it a valuable asset in an ethical education.

In this way, utilitarianism and virtue ethics offer strong justifications for the responsible use of GPT in academic settings. From a utilitarian perspective, it maximizes benefits for a large number of students by improving accessibility to educational resources and enhancing the learning process. Through the lens of virtue ethics, GPT aids in the cultivation of intellectual virtues like curiosity and wisdom, promoting the development of virtuous learners. Ultimately, GPT is not just a tool to enhance education but a means of fostering personal and intellectual growth when used ethically and responsibly.

# In no more than half a page, consider and refute a potential objection to the position you staked out in the above question.

An objection to the use of GPT in academic settings is rooted in deontology, which emphasizes strictly following rules and duties. Many universities have established clear guidelines that prohibit the use of AI tools like GPT for assignments due to concerns about academic dishonesty, plagiarism, and fear that students will not be genuinely learning. From this perspective, it would be morally wrong to use GPT, even if it enhances learning, because it violates established rules, and students have a duty to comply with institutional policies.

However, this objection can be refuted by recognizing that rules continue to evolve with new technologies and educational needs. In the current state, the educational system is cautious about the use of GPT as they are still understanding how AI could be ethically incorporated into learning. Just as calculators and computers were once controversial in academic settings, AI tools can be used responsibly within guidelines that emphasize academic integrity, enhancing education rather than replacing effort. Therefore, the objection, while valid in the short term, does not preclude the ethical and justifiable use of ChatGPT in the future.

# Submit a prompt to ChatGPT asking it to adopt the persona of a moral philosophy professor and defend whether the use of Chat GPT in academic settings is morally justifiable. Specifically, you should prompt GPT to use the principle(s) you referenced in question 1. Include a summary of the GPT response, and discuss how this differs or coincides with your response in question 1. (In essence, we are curious whether GPT can justify itself!)

ChatGPT, adopting the persona of a moral philosophy professor, defended the use of GPT in academic settings through the lens of utilitarianism and virtue ethics. It argued that, from a utilitarian perspective, GPT enhances accessibility to education, provides immediate explanations, and maximizes learning for a broad range of students. The flexibility of the tool allows for inclusive learning, ultimately promoting the greatest good by improving learning outcomes. From a virtue ethics perspective, GPT helps foster intellectual virtues such as curiosity, diligence, and wisdom. When used responsibly, it contributes to the moral and intellectual growth of students, helping them explore complex ideas and persist in their studies, thus cultivating good character and intellectual habits.

Both my response and ChatGPTâ€™s response agree on the main points regarding the justification for using GPT in academic settings. From a utilitarian standpoint, we both highlight how GPT enhances learning by making education more accessible and flexible for students with different learning styles. We agree that the tool promotes the greatest good by helping a large number of students better understand difficult concepts through immediate assistance and detailed explanations, ultimately benefiting their educational experience. However, GPT's response also talked about how it could make learning more inclusive and help people who come from backgrounds where they do not have access to the same resources. I felt like this was a major factor that gives GPT an upper hand in academia, as it makes the playing field even for everyone.

When it comes to virtue ethics, both responses emphasize the role of GPT in fostering intellectual virtues like curiosity, diligence, and wisdom. We both recognize that GPT, when used ethically, encourages students to explore complex ideas and persist in their studies, which helps develop strong intellectual habits. I focused more on how GPT can cultivate these virtues over time, specifically noting how it encourages students to engage in deeper learning and take initiative in their educational journeys, while ChatGPT provided a broader overview of these virtues.
